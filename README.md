# JSON_Pandas

Well Hi there,

One my favorite coding tool is Pandas. If you are also a non-computer science/engineer and looking forward to use JSON data for your analysis, using Pandas, I provide the code  with real examples from World Bank data that is in JSON format. Please find the code json_exercise.ipynb.
